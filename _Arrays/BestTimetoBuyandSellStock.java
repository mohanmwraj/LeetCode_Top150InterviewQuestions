        * The points of interest are the peaks and valleys in the given graph.
        *
        * We need to find the largest price following each valley, which difference could be the max profit.
        * We can maintain two variables - minprice and maxprofit corresponding to the smallest valley and maximum profit (maximum difference between selling price and minprice) obtained so far respectively.
